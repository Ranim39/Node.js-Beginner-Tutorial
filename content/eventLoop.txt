How Node.js Event Loop Handles Many Requests

1. Node.js is single-threaded for JavaScript, but uses an event loop for asynchronous tasks.
2. When multiple users send requests (e.g. 1000 DB queries):
   - Each query is sent asynchronously.
   - Node.js does NOT wait for the database response.
   - The event loop immediately moves on to handle the next request.
3. When the database responds, its callback is added to the event loop queue.
4. Node.js processes callbacks when the stack is free, sending the response to each user.

Result:
Node.js can handle thousands of concurrent requests without blocking, thanks to the event loop.
